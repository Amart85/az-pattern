### Enabling the mgmt_junos Routing Instance
### The name of the dedicated management instance is reserved and hardcoded as mgmt_junos; 
### you are prevented from configuring any other routing instance by the name mgmt_junos. 
### Once the mgmt_junos routing instance is deployed, management traffic no longer shares a routing table 
### (that is, the default inet.0 table) with other control or protocol traffic in the system
### Tables for the mgmt_junos table are set up for inet and inet6 and marked as private tables. 
### The management interface is moved to the mgmt_junos routing table.
### At the point where you commit the configuration, if you are using SSH or telnet, 
### the connection to the device will be dropped and you will have to reestablish it.
